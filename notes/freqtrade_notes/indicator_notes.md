# MACD
Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security’s price. The MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA.

The result of that calculation is the MACD line. A nine-day EMA of the MACD called the "signal line," is then plotted on top of the MACD line, which can function as a trigger for buy and sell signals. Traders may buy the security when the MACD crosses above its signal line and sell - or short - the security when the MACD crosses below the signal line. Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicators can be interpreted in several ways, but the more common methods are crossovers, divergences, and rapid rises/falls.

# heikinashi
The Heikin-Ashi chart is constructed like a regular candlestick chart, except the formula for calculating each bar is different, as shown above. The time series is defined by the user, depending on the type of chart desired, such as daily, hourly or five-minute intervals. The down days are represented by filled candles, while the up days are represented by empty candles. These can also be colored in by the chart platform, so up days are white or green, and down days are red or black.

```
so pretty much, it's a converted regular candle stick chart, where the values are dependant on previous candle stick + new data. It means less wicks on positive and negative, resulting in clear trends.

Downtrend with no wicks twoards positive = downslope

Uptrend with no wicks twoards negative = positive

Wicks = possible change in direction

# STOCHASTIC
## Variations include **FAST STOCHASTIC** (more sensitive) and **SLOW STOCHASTIC** (less sensitive)
A stochastic oscillator is a momentum indicator comparing a particular closing price of a security to a range of its prices over a certain period of time. The sensitivity of the oscillator to market movements is reducible by adjusting that time period or by taking a moving average of the result. It is used to generate overbought and oversold trading signals, utilizing a 0-100 bounded range of values.
```
It is similar to RSI in how it is used

"The stochastic oscillator is predicated on the assumption that closing prices should close near the same direction as the current trend. RSI tracks overbought and oversold levels by measuring the velocity of price movements. More analysts use RSI over the stochastic oscillator, but both are well-known and reputable technical indicators."

# CDLHAMMER - Candle Hammer
A hammer is a type of bullish reversal candlestick pattern, made up of just one candle, found in price charts of financial assets. The candle looks like a hammer, as it has a long lower wick and a short body at the top of the candlestick with little or no upper wick. In order for a candle to be a valid hammer most traders say the lower wick must be two times greater than the size of the body portion of the candle, and the body of the candle must be at the upper end of the trading range.
```
may point to a reversal in signal if the long wick is in the reverse direction of where the trend is headed

# MFI - Money Flow Index
## Also known as **Volume-Weighted RSI**

The Money Flow Index (MFI) is a technical oscillator that uses price and volume data for identifying overbought or oversold signals in an asset. It can also be used to spot divergences which warn of a trend change in price. The oscillator moves between 0 and 100.

# Fisher Transform
The Fisher Transform enables traders to create a Gaussian normal distribution, which converts data that isn't typically normal distributed (like market prices). In essence, the transformation makes peak swings relatively rare events to help better identify price reversals on a chart. The technical indicator is commonly used by traders looking for leading signals rather than lagging indicators.

The Fisher Transform can also be applied to other technical indicators, such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) or Moving Average Convergence-Divergence (MACD).

```
This can be used in was such as Fisher RSI

# ADX - Average Directional Index
ADX is used to quantify trend strength. ADX calculations are based on a moving average of price range expansion over a given period of time. The default setting is 14 bars, although other time periods can be used.1﻿ ADX can be used on any trading vehicle such as stocks, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds and futures.

```
High ADX means its trending, positive or negative

# DMI - Directional Movement Indicator
The Directional Movement Index, or DMI, is an indicator developed by J. Welles Wilder in 1978 that identifies in which direction the price of an asset is moving. The indicator does this by comparing prior highs and lows and drawing two lines: a positive directional movement line (+DI) and a negative directional movement line (-DI). An optional third line, called directional movement (DX) shows the difference between the lines. When +DI is above -DI, there is more upward pressure than downward pressure in the price. If -DI is above +DI, then there is more downward pressure in the price. This indicator may help traders assess the trend direction. Crossovers between the lines are also sometimes used as trade signals to buy or sell.

ADX lines are derived from DMI lines
